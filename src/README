WIN32:
---------------------------------------
- The framework uses the in Windows included version of Opengl and GLU.
- The library files, Headers and DLL's of SDL and DevIL are included in the direcories ./lib/ ./include/ and ./Debug and ./Release respectively
- There is a Microsoft Visual Express 2008 Solution file included: 'oopFramework.sln'
- If you want to use another IDE, you have to create your own Project file
- If you plan to use a Makefile to develop under Windows, there is already a working one in ./oopframework/Makefile
LINUX/OTHER
---------------------------------------
- use the Makefile to compile the program
- make sure that you've installed libsdl1.2-dev, libdevil-dev, libglew1.5-dev and all the other OpenGL dependencies (os dependent) in order to compile the Program successfully
- the final binary is copied into the folder ./Release after successful build
